# Frequenly Asked Questions

## How fast is SEGUL?

We test the command line version of SEGUL using Oliveros et al. alignments. It can process >4000 UCE loci on Macbook Air 2015 with 4-core (8 thread) CPU and 4 Gb of RAM. It still does it faster than running a similar program using Biophyton library on a faster computer equipped with a 12-core (24-thread) Ryzen 3900x CPU and 32 Gb of RAM. See more comparison with other similar application in the [benchmark](https://github.com/hhandika/segul-bench).
