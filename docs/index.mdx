# Thank you for using SEGUL! 🙏🏻

`segul` is an ultrafast and memory efficient alignment tool to manipulate alignment files and generate sequence statistics for them. The app is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a fast, memory safe, and data race free programming language. It is a compiled app with zero runtime dependency. In other words, you need not worry about dependencies or conflicts with other software.

`segul`'s low memory footprint allows the app to run on a computer with limited RAM. In our test, `segul` can process >4000 UCE loci on Macbook Air 2015 with 4-core (8 thread) CPU and 4 Gb of RAM. It still does it faster than running a similar program using Biophyton library on a faster computer equipped with a 12-core (24-thread) Ryzen 3900x CPU and 32 Gb of RAM.

**SEGUL soon will be available in GUI version!** 🎉🎉🎉

It will bring nearly similar speed and memory efficiency as the command line version, but will support both desktop and mobile operating system. The GUI version is still in development. Checkout the progress [here](https://github.com/hhandika/segui).
