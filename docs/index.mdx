# Thank you for using SEGUL! 🙏🏻

`segul` is an ultrafast and memory efficient alignment tool to manipulate alignment files and generate sequence statistics for them. The app is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a fast, memory safe, and data race free programming language. It is a compiled app with zero runtime dependency. In other words, you don't have to worry about dependencies or conflicts with other software.

`segul`'s low memory footprint allows the app to run on a computer with limited RAM. In our test, `segul` can process >4000 UCE loci on Macbook Air 2015 with 4-core (8 thread) CPU and 4 Gb of RAM. It still does it faster than running a similar program using Biophyton library on a faster computer equipped with a 12-core (24-thread) Ryzen 3900x CPU and 32 Gb of RAM.
