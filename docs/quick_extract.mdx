# Extracting sequences in alignments

You can also extract sequences from a collection of alignments. It can be done by supplying a list of IDs directly using the command line or in a text file. `segul` will look for the exact match of the IDs and is case sensitive. You can also use regular expression for more flexiple option.

To extract sequences by inputing the IDs in the command line:

```bash
segul extract --dir [path-to-alignment-directory] --input-format [sequence-format-keyword] --id [id_1] [id_2] [id_3]
```

Using `--input` (or `-i` in short version) option ([learn the difference](https://github.com/hhandika/segul/wiki/4.-Command-Options#input-options)):

```bash
segul extract --input [a-path/wilcard-to-files] --id [id_1] [id_2] [id_3]
```

You can specify as many id as you would like. However, for a long list of IDs, it may be more convenient to input a text file. In the file, the content should be only the list of IDs, one ID each line:

```bash
sequence_1
sequence_2
sequence_3
sequence_4
```

The the command will be:

```bash
segul extract --dir [path-to-alignment-directory] --input-format [sequence-format-keyword] --file [path-to-text-file]
```

For using regular expression:

```bash
segul extract -d gblock_trimmed_80p/ -f nexus --re="regex-syntax"
```

`segul` uses the rust [regex library](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/) to parse regular expression. The syntax is similar to Perl regular expression (find out more [here](https://docs.rs/regex/1.5.4/regex/)).
