# Mapping sample distribution in a collection of alignments

If you would like to know how the samples distributed across your alignments, you only need to add the `--map` flag when searching for unique IDs. It will generate both the unique IDs (in a text file) and the sample distribution in boolean format (save to a csv file).

Using a `--dir` (or `-d` in short version):

```Bash
segul id --dir [a-path-to-a-directory] --input-format [sequence-format-keyword] --map
```

Using `--input` (or `-i` in short version) option ([learn the difference](https://github.com/hhandika/segul/wiki/4.-Command-Options#input-options)):

```Bash
segul id --input [a-path/wilcard-to-files] --map
```
