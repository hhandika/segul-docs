# Overview

We want the installation to be as flexible as possible. We offer three ways to install the app. Each of the options has pros and cons.

1. Using a pre-compiled binary. The quickest and the most straigtforward installation route.
2. Using the Rust package manager, cargo. It is similar to pip for python, gem for ruby, npm for JavaScript, etc. Cargo is a part of the Rust programming language toolchain. The toolchain is small and easy to install ([see below](#installing-through-cargo)). Cargo will also help to manage the app and allow for a quick update whenever the new version is released. In addition, the resulting executable will be fine-tuned for your system.
3. Compiling it from the source in the Github repository. It gives you the most up to date version, but the resulting binary may not be fully tested.
4. Installing from the development branch. We keep new features in the development branch until we finish testing them. This installation method will allow you to test them.
