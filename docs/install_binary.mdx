## Using a pre-compiled binary

The pre-compiled binary is available in [the release page](https://github.com/hhandika/segul/releases/). The typical workflow is as follow:

1. Download the zip file in [the release page](https://github.com/hhandika/segul/releases/) to your computer, using a browser or using a command line app.
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Make the binary executable (Linux and MacOS only).
4. Put it in a folder registered in your environment variable. It can be run from the folder where you extract the app too, but this option is less convenient when dealing with datasets in different folders or storage partitions.

See specific details below:

### Linux/WSL/MacOS

First, copy the link to the zip file in [the release page](https://github.com/hhandika/segul/releases/). We provide two versions of the app for Linux. The zip file labeled with ManyLinux is compiled using Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.9 (Kernel Version 3.10). If you are running the app in HPC, you should use this version. The other version (labeled Linux only) is compiled using [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Kernel version 5.8)](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md). You should use this if you are using more up to date native Linux distributions. This version also works on WSL. Simply put, if you encounter [GLIBC](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) error, try using the HPC version. If the issue still persists, try to [install the app using cargo](#installing-through-cargo).

For MacOS, the executables are available for Intel Macs (x86_64) and Apple ARM Macs, such as Apple M1 series.

Here, we use the version 0.3.1 as an example. You should replace the link with the most up to date version available in the release page.

- Download the binary.

```Bash

wget https://github.com/hhandika/segul/releases/download/v0.3.1/segul-MacOS-x86_64.zip
```

- Unzip the file.

```Bash
unzip segul-MacOS-x86_64.zip
```

- Make it executable

```Bash
chmod +x segul
```

If you would like the binary executable for all users:

```Bash
chmod a+x segul
```

The next step is putting the binary in a folder registered in your PATH variable. It is always best to avoid registering too many paths in your environment variable. It will slow down your terminal startup. If you already used a single executable cli app, the chance is that you may already have a folder registered in your path variable. Copy SEGUL executable to the folder. Then, try call SEGUL from anywhere in your system:

```Bash
segul --version
```

It should show the SEGUL version number.

If you would like to setup a folder in your environment variable, take a look at simple-qc [installation instruction](https://github.com/hhandika/simple-qc).

### Windows

The installation procedure is similar to the MacOS or Linux. After downloading the zip file for Windows and extracting it, you will setup your environment variable that point to the path where you will put the executable. In Windows, this is usually done using GUI. Follow this amazing guideline from the stakoverflow [to setup the environment variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho). After setup, copy the segul.exe file to the folder.
