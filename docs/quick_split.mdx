# Splitting concatenated alignments by partitions

To split alignment by partitions, you need the alignment file and the alignment partition. If the input partition file is not provided, `segul` will assume the partition is in the alignment file. It will fail to run if it could not find the partition in the input alignment.

The input option accepts a single file only. The `--dir` option is not available for this subcommand.

```Bash
segul split --input [a-path-to-a-concatenated-alignment] --input-part [a-path-to-partition-file]
```

By default, `segul` will use the alignment name as an output directory. To provide the output directory name, use the `--output` or `-o` option.
For the resulting alignments, `segul` will use the locus name in the partition file as the output filename. You can prefix this filename by using `--prefix` option. The resulting filenames will be `prefix_locus-name.file-extension`.
