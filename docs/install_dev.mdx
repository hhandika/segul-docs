# Try development version

We welcome our users to try new features as we develop them. These features usually only partially or have not been tested. We do not reccomend them to be used for your research project.

The features are in the development branch and listed as upcoming in the Readme file. The installation process is similar to installing from [Github Repository](#installing-from-a-github-repository) and add `--branch dev` in the command line arguments as below:

```Bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/hhandika/segul.git --branch dev
```
