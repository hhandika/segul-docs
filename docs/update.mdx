# Updating SEGUl

If you install the app using cargo, updating the app is the same as installing it:

```Bash
cargo install segul
```

Cargo will check whether the version of the app in your computer different from the version in the Rust package repository ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/segul)) and will install the newer version if it is available. Similar procedure is also applied for installing from the GitHub repository:

```Bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/hhandika/segul.git
```

If you used the pre-compiled binary, replace the old binary with the newer version manually.
