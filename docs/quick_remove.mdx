# Batch removing sequence based on user-defined IDs

Based on a list of IDs, you can remove sequences in a collection of alignments.

```Bash
segul remove --dir [alignment-dir] -f [sequence-format-keyword] --id [list-of-id]
```

Using regular expression:

```Bash
segul remove --dir [alignment-dir] -f [sequence-format-keyword] --re=["regex"]
```

If you remove more than a half of the sequence, `segul`'s extract feature is more efficient.
